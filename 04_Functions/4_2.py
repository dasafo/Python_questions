# Create a function with variable length of arguments

# Write a program to create function func1() to accept
# a variable length of arguments and print their value.

# Note: Create a function in such a way that we can pass
# any number of arguments to this function, and the function
# should process them and display each argumentâ€™s value.

    for i in args:
